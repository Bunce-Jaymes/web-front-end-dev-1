    <h1>The Process</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>If you send in your disc we are able to convert it into a digital code in at most three days. Our advisors evaluate your disc, to make sure it's in good condition to be traded. </p>
    <p>As the processes starts, you are sent email updates on the status of your trades. Once everything is complete you will receive an email with instructions on how to download your game <u>on the platform the disc came to us in.</u></p>
    <p>At this time, <strong>we are NOT able to trade cross-platform.</strong></p>
    <p>For example, we can NOT trade Call of Duty: WWII on Xbox for, Call of Duty: WWII on PlayStation.</p>
    <p>If a disc is not in the correct trade condition to trade we contact you (via email). Asking if you would like the disc back, or for us to add points based on the quality and trade value of the disc's current condition.</p>
