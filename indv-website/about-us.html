    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Hi, my name is Jaymes, I am the owner of <abbr title="Disc 2 Digital">D2D</abbr> and I am a gamer. I know the frustration of having to buy discs in 2018. We have these amazing and powerful consoles, <strong><u>yet we have to download the game even if we have the disc!</u></strong></p>
    <p>At D2D, we are focused on providing the easiest video game purchasing service available. No extra ads, no annoying email lists, or pop-ups.</p>
    <p>We are a small company located in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rexburg,+ID/@43.8300451,-111.8582212,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x53540a4b807a98b1:0x4a49d8d1d2181c73!8m2!3d43.8231096!4d-111.7924237/">Rexburg, Idaho.</a> We are trying to provide the fastest and best trading service possible. We understand the hassle of trying to organize discs and to deal with game sharing, so we want to make this easy for you.</p>
    <p>Are we <emb>GameStop?</emb> <strong>No,</strong> thank heaven NO! We know that games are <u>actually worth money.</u> Thatâ€™s why we guarantee that we can offer the best value  of discs through our partnerships with the big gaming companies. Plus, the discs are reused to help create more video game discs, movie discs, program discs, (etc.)</p>
